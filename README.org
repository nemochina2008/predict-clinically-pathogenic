What is the test error for the best univariate classifier using each
feature?

** 17 Feb 2016

First train data set from Najmeh, 1200 observations (genomic
variants/positions) x 7 scores.

Computed test error via 5-fold CV of tree and forest models, which are
definitely more accurate than a trivial majority classifier.
