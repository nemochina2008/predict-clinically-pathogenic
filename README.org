Computed the test error for the best univariate thresholding
classifier using each feature. The best features seem to be Polyphen2
and CADD, but the multivariate ctree and cforest models definitely
seem to be more accurate.

First train data set from Najmeh, 1200 observations (genomic
variants/positions) x 7 scores.

Computed test error via 5-fold CV of tree and forest models, which are
definitely more accurate than a trivial majority classifier.
