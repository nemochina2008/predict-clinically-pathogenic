Computed the test error for the best univariate thresholding
classifier using each feature. The best univariate thresholding models
are Polyphen2 and CADD, but the multivariate ctree and cforest models
definitely seem to be more accurate.

I also fit ctree and cforest models for all pairs of scores. The pair
of scores that comes closest to the 7-score model is CADD and SIFT. I
used them to create the following visualization of the predicted
probabilities of the tree and forest models (when trained in this
two-dimensional feature space).

First train data set from Najmeh, 1200 observations (genomic
variants/positions) x 7 scores.

Computed test error via 5-fold CV of tree and forest models, which are
definitely more accurate than a trivial majority classifier.
